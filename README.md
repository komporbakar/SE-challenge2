# Building a Microblog API

This challenge will test your skills in backend engineering across various facets, including:

- Framework proficiency: Demonstrate your ability to utilize any JS or GO backend framework of your choice (e.g., Express, Sails) to build a robust and scalable API.
- API design: Show your understanding of RESTful API principles by designing a clean and well-documented API for a microblogging platform.
- SQL skills: Write efficient and accurate SQL queries to handle CRUD operations on user data, posts, and comments.
- Git workflow: Submit your solution by cloning a provided Git repository and creating a pull request with your changes.
- Code quality: Focus on writing clean, well-formatted, and maintainable code with proper documentation and error handling.

## Scenario:

You are tasked with building the backend for a simple microblogging platform. Users can create accounts, write posts, follow other users, and comment on posts. The API should allow for the following functionalities:

- User registration and authentication
- User profile management
- Post creation, editing, and deletion
- Following other users
- Viewing public and follower-specific post streams
- Commenting on posts

## Requirements:

- Choose a popular JS or Go backend framework of your choice (e.g., Express, Sails).
- Design a RESTful API with clear endpoints and consistent resource representation.
- Implement user authentication using a secure method (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user and post data.
- Write efficient SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
- Implement unit and/or integration tests for your code.
- Document your API with concise descriptions and examples.

## Bonus points:

- Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- Add search functionality for posts and users.
- Implement notification system for comments and interactions.
- Deploy your API to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

## Evaluation:

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Completeness: Does your API implement all the required functionalities?
- Correctness: Is your code bug-free and does it perform the intended operations?
- Efficiency: Are your SQL queries and API endpoints optimized for performance?
- Maintainability: Is your code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
- Test coverage: Are your unit and/or integration tests comprehensive and effective?
- Overall design and implementation: Does your solution demonstrate good engineering practices and best choices for the given scenario?
- We encourage you to be creative and showcase your skills in building a clean, efficient, and scalable microblog API. Good luck!
